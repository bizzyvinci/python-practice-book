# python-practice-book
I'm trying to learn python by practice and "practice python book" by Anand Chitipothu has been really helpful.

There are several problems in one file.
The reason is because the problems are not long and are usually similar to another problem. 
This method also allow me to reference other problems.

Each %(chapter number)d%(name)s.py file is for the problems in that chapter.
Each problem is enclosed in multi-string comment. To run a particular problem remove the comments (and make sure others are enclosed in comment).

There are other files. The she.txt and she_out.txt are for some particular problems where we had to work with text files.
You can edit them to see how the program runs.

You can find the book at https://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html. 
The git repository is on https://github.com/anandology/python-practice-book.
